# MinecraftNavigatorGUI
A GUI to be used with the Baritone Forge API

You can find Baritone here: https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone

# Explanation
Why the dependency on Baritone? Because I'm not writing a full A* pathfinding algorithm for Minecraft, because of the difficulty of doing that in a fully 3D environment compared with a 2D grid.

This provides a front-end Graphical environment within the game from which to use Baritone's functionality from.

# Installation

Put this in your mods folder with 1.12.2 forge. You will need a 1.2.X version release of Baritone, not a 1.3.X as this is built for 1.12.2, not 1.13. You can go ahead and build a .jar for 1.13, but I'm not certain it will work.

You can press H to open the menu for it. Alternatively, you can rebind this in the controls.
